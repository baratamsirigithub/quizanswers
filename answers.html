        <h1>What is Covid-19</h1>
        <p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.</p>

        <h1>What is the difference between Isolation and Quarantine?</h1>
        <p>Both isolation and quarantine are methods of preventing the spread of COVID-19.</p>
        <p><kbd>Quarantine</kbd> is used for anyone who is a contact of someone infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, whether the infected person has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you remain separated from others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and can take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means staying in the facility or at home for 14 days.</p>
        <p><kbd>Isolation</kbd> is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive for the virus. Being in isolation means being separated from other people, ideally in a medically facility where you can receive clinical care.  If isolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high risk group of developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home. If you have symptoms, you should remain in isolation for at least 10 days plus an additional 3 days without symptoms. If you are infected and do not develop symptoms, you should remain in isolation for 10 days from the time you test positive. </p>

        <h1>What is Vaccination?</h1>
        <p>Vaccination is a simple, safe, and effective way of protecting you against harmful diseases, before you come into contact with them. It uses your body’s natural defenses to build resistance to specific infections and makes your immune system stronger.</p>
        <p>Vaccines train your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it’s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications. Most vaccines are given by an injection, but some are given orally (by mouth) or sprayed into the nose.</p>
        
        <h1>What are the Symptoms of COVID-19?</h1>
        <ol>Dry Cough</ol>
        <ol>Fever</ol>
        <ol>Fatigue</ol>

        <h1>How long does it take to develop symptoms of Covid-19?</h1>
        <p>The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available.</p>

        <h1>To Refer Queries about Vaccination</h1>
        <p>WHO has reviewed and ‘certified’ many websites across the world that
            provide only information based on reliable scientific evidence and independent reviews by leading technical experts.
            These websites are all members of the Vaccine Safety Net</p>
